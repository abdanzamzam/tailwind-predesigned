# tailwind-predesigned

An old project in my free time's free time. If the design looks bad, blame my past.

## Objectives
- Development-experience for the maintainer
- Easy-to-preview for the frontend code
- Copy-paste ready for the consumer

## Todo
A lot

## Development

To start developing, clone this repository first. You will see the following directory structure:

```
├── predesigned-tailwind
│   ├── frontend
│   ├── playgrounds
```

**Frontend**

This folder contains the consumer facing app, which is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

**Playgrounds**

This folder contains the playgrounds for the designs. Currently, only the HTML playground is available.

Available commands:
- `dev [design-name]` – start development server
- `build [design-name]` – compile the design to the `out/` directory
- `www [design-name]` – server the design that already built
- `push [design-name]` – push design from the `out/` directory to the `frontend/public/designs` directory

* `[design-name]` is a directory name of the design. Simply, just omit it, it will bring up a list of designs.
