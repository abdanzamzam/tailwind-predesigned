# tailwind-predesigned

An old project in my free time's free time.

## Objectives
- Development-experience for the maintainer
- Easy-to-preview for the frontend code
- Copy-paste ready for the consumer

## Development

To start developing, clone this repository first. You will see the following directory structure:

```
├── awesome-predesigned-tailwind
│   ├── frontend
│   ├── playgrounds
```

**Frontend**

This folder contains the consumer facing app, which is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

**Playgrounds**

This folder contains the playgrounds for the designs. Currently, only the HTML playground is available.
